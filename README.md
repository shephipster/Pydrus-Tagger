# Pydrus-Tagger
Takes a Hydrus server and tags images using SauceNao and its results. Written and Python and can be used for more than just Hydrus.

Most everything is as simple as importing and calling. By and large though, you'll want to just use the sauceNaoApi::getAllTags method,
but this is just a small hobby project so do what you want with this. Make a discord bot that pings your friends for them, tags your
private Hydrus library, it's all up to you.

How to use:
  you _can_ call it directly with python3 sauceNaoApi.py <url>
  You'll need to have a .env file that contains all of your API keys because I am _NOT_ giving mine out
  You can also import from sauceNaoApi if you want
  
Imported libraries
  Request
  python-dotenv
  
Notice:
  I have written AI, Machine Learning algorithms, multivariate calculus solvers, and auto-pinging Discord bots in Python, so naturally
  I have not Earthly idea how I have managed to write any of this. If something's busted don't expect any fast fixes.
